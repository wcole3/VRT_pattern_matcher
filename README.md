# VRT_pattern_matcher
A pattern matching script for VRT transitions

A pattern matching script used to aid in the assignment of vibrational-rotational-tunneling transitions obtained from 
high resolution spectroscopy

The script uses user defined tolerances which limits its applicability to clusters with known structures
